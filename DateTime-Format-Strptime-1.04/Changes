Revision history for Perl module DateTime::Format::Strptime

Note on version conventions:
0.0000
|  | |
|  | +- Minor Decimal
|  +---- Major Decimal
+------- Whole Number

* Whole numbers are rewrite releases. They contain major rewrites
  or alterations to the API. Read the docs before using them.
* Major decimal number is patch release. Some coding has changed
  but the API remains the same (or is extended). Upgrading to 
  these should not change any expected behaviour, however it
  will alter buggy behaviour. Read the docs and check if you've
  been using work-arounds before using them.
* Minor decimal number is a doc or installer patch only. If you have
  the module installed and understand how it works, you don't need
  this release.

        - original version - posted to DateTime mailing list

1.00.00 Sun, 27 Apr 2003 17:56:27 +1000
	- first release version
        - first CPAN release
		- added tests
		- should be 100% compatible with DateTime's strftime function
		
1.00.01 Mon, 28 Apr 2003 07:12:01 +1000
	- the 'what the hell is that' release
		- removed alien life-forms (characters that didn't ASCIIfy)
	* No API change, just made it so it will install now!

1.00.02 Tue, 29 Apr 2003 07:03:19 + 1000
	- the 'please the testers' release
		- Fixed a test that only worked in DateTime was from CVS
		- Fixed two issues noted by Iain Truskett:
		- Removed a diag() in test 1 that was just there for
		  testing the test
		- Added a linebreak to the end of the MANIFEST

1.0100 Sun, 11 May 2003 13:54:36 + 1000
	- the 'nanozone' release
		- If we have the latest DateTime we run the test mentioned above
		- Fixed my version format as advised by Iain Truskett
		  if it still doesn't work it's because of me, not him
		- Added the ability to handle nanoseconds as requested by 
		  Michael Goltze.
		- Got Time Zones working, including mapping non-ambiguous TLAs
		  offsets and Olsen names (the latter uses the %q token)


1.0101 Tue, 13 May 2003 07:58:23 + 1000
	- the 'oldtimers' release
		- Fixed a test that was broken if DateTime::TimeZone was not
		  version 0.13 or above.
		  
1.0102 Fri, 16 May 2003 07:28:18 + 1000
	- the 'wonky test' release
		- Fixed the same test as above. Think I actually succeeded 
		  this time!

1.0103 Wed, 28 May 2003 20:10:57 +1000
	- the 'What's up Docs' release
		- Applied doc patches from Iain Truskett (Thanks!)
		- Clarified parameter discrepancy between synopsis and docs
		  (Thanks Chris Winters)
		  
1.0200 Wed, 28 May 2003 21:02:03 +1000
	- the 'Proclavity to croak' release
		- The docs for Time::Local talk about the 'proclavity to croak'
		  which basically means the module croaks easily. So did this
		  one until now.
		  
		  Until now, if you allowed a user to specify a pattern and they
		  entered one that was non parsable, this module would croak
		  causing your script to croak. This is a Bad Thing (tm).
		  
		  The behaviour now remains the same, however if you set
		  $DateTime::Format::StrpTime::CROAK to false, methods will 
		  return undef rather than croaking. 
		  $DateTime::Format::StrpTime::errmsg will tell you what went
		  wrong. 
		  
		  The default is to continue to croak. This means you have to
		  delibrately turn it off. Hopefully you'll change you script 
		  to do this at the same time you change it to check the
		  return values of the methods :)

1.0300 Sat, 07 Jun 2003 10:40:23 +1000
	- the 'Better way to die' release
		- The above has changed by request of Dave Rolsky and Iain 
		  Truskett (Thanks!). We now allow each object to have its
		  own behavior. 
		- The default behavior has been changed to returning undef.
		  This was requested by someone (tell me if it was you!) and
		  made a lot of sense to me.
	- Never released to CPAN

1.0301 Wed, 25 Jun 2003 22:40:12 +1000
	- the 'Day of Year' release
		- Updated to handle the post 0.12 DateTime that now
		  validates dates. Still handles old DateTime.

1.0302 Sat, 28 Jun 2003 09:15:21 +1000
	- the 'Broken Windows' release
		- Test 004 was failing on Windows due to the path delimiter
		  being a backslash rather than a slash. This release should
		  also fix Strptime for Mac users, although I've had no
		  complaints from such users. (Myself being one of the only
		  ones currently using Strptime AFAIK!) Thanks Ron Hill for
		  the bug report.

1.0400 Sun, 10 Aug 2003 00:22:00 +1000
	- the 'locale' release
		- Applied patches from Joshua Hoblitt to move the the brand
		  new DateTime::Locale rather than the old ::Language modules
		- Implemented %x, %X and %c for locale formats
		- Fixed a bug on the two digit year determinator
		- Added a test for locales known as 004locale.t
	- This is a major change and you should install this release if
	  you are using DateTime >= 0.14 (the first release with Locale)
