DateTime::Format::Strptime 

This module replicates most of Strptime for DateTime. Strptime is the
unix command that is the reverse of Strftime. While Strftime takes a
DateTime and outputs it in a given format, Strptime takes a DateTime and
a format and returns the DateTime object associated.

lib/DateTime/Format/Strptime.pm



INSTALLATION: 

Use CPAN or CPANPLUS - there's no config in the process that requires
you to do anything strange.

For those of you who like it the manual way, the recipe is the same as
normal: 

   perl Makefile.PL
   make 
   make test
   make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

This module contains no XS code and thus should install anywhere.
