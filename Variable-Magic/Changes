Revision history for Variable-Magic

0.43    2010-06-25 23:35 UTC
        + Add : The new constant VMG_COMPAT_GLOB_GET tells you whether get magic
                is called for globs. It's true starting perl 5.13.2.
        + Chg : All callbacks are now called within an eval-like context.
                Only free callbacks used to be called that way.
        + Fix : Some exceptions thrown from a free callback could be lost.
        + Fix : Croak messages could sometimes be repeated several times.
        + Fix : t/41-clone.t segfaulting with perl 5.13.2.

0.42    2010-05-19 00:15 UTC
        This is a maintenance release. The code contains no functional change.
        Users of 0.41 can skip this update.
        + Fix : Test failures with perl 5.13.
        + Tst : Improve coverage.

0.41    2010-03-15 17:35 UTC
        + Doc : Tweaks and fixups.
                Thanks Shlomi Fish.
        + Fix : Compatibility with the soon-to-be-released perl 5.12.0.
        + Fix : Correctly propagate the errors thrown when variable destruction
                happens at compile-time and not from inside eval STRING.
                Thanks Florian Ragwitz and Ash Berlin for reporting.

0.40    2010-01-06 23:20 UTC
        + Fix : Possible memory miswrites when passing data arguments to cast().
        + Fix : Minor C portability tweaks.

0.39    2009-12-01 00:05 UTC
        + Add : You can use a function name as a callback by passing a string
                reference to wizard() instead of a code reference.
        + Fix : Compatiblity with perl 5.11.1 and 5.11.2.
        + Fix : Scalars stored into the data slot no longer leak.
        + Fix : Thread destruction should not segfault anymore.
        + Opt : As a result of removing the deprecated features, less memory is
                used for both threaded (a pointer table is used instead of a
                hash) and non-threaded (no global structure is needed anymore)
                perls.
        + Rem : As advertised in the precendent version, all the signature
                related features were removed. This includes the 'sig' option
                to wizard(), the getsig() and gensig() functions, and the SIG_*
                constants.

0.38    2009-10-04 16:10 UTC
        + Dep : All the signature-related features are DEPRECATED and will be
                removed in december 2009. This includes the 'sig' option to
                wizard(), the getsig() and gensig() functions, and the SIG_*
                constants.
                Afaik those features were never used in real life, and they make
                the XS code slow and brittle. If you want your wizards to be
                globally available, you'll have to handle that yourself by
                storing them in a hash.
        + Doc : More examples in a new COOKBOOK section.
        + Fix : Compatiblity with the 5.11.0 release. The new compatibility
                constant VMG_COMPAT_ARRAY_PUSH_NOLEN_VOID was added to cover
                this.
        + Fix : Work around Kwalitee test misfailures.

0.37    2009-08-25 15:25 UTC
        + Add : The new constant VMG_FORKSAFE can be tested to know whether the
                module will behave nicely when fork()ing. It's currently always
                true except on Windows where you need perl 5.10.1 for it to be
                true.
        + Doc : Nits and clarifications.

0.36    2009-07-05 16:30 UTC
        + Chg : getdata() now returns an empty list when no magic is present.
                It used to return undef but did not croak as stated in the doc.
                Thanks Matt S. Trout for pointing this out.
        + Fix : Building and tests with ActiveState Perl 5.8 build >= 822.

0.35    2009-05-15 20:50 UTC
        This is a maintenance release. Users of 0.34 can skip this update.
        + Chg : uvar magic used to be enabled for 5.9.5. It now requires 5.10 or
                later.
        + Fix : Silence compilation warnings for cxinc().
        + Rem : The workaround introduced in 0.31 for the "Unknown errors" issue
                was removed, as regression tests show that 0.34 provides a
                better fix.
        + Tst : Skip t/40-threads.t on 5.8.x with old versions of threads and
                threads::shared.

0.34    2009-04-19 16:55 UTC
        + Fix : Destruction of wizards in require.
        + Fix : "panic: restartop" in 5.10 when dieing at compile time triggers
                a destructor.

0.33    2009-03-26 00:00 UTC
        + Chg : cast() and getsig() now croak too when an invalid signature is
                passed.
        + Fix : It was possible to generate with gensig() the same signature
                twice before actually defining the wizards.
        + Tst : More stash tests.
        + Tst : Test when the magic takes place in some cases.
        + Tst : Improved coverage for the op object feature.

0.32    2009-03-01 13:45 UTC
        + Chg : dispell() and getdata() now croak when an invalid signature is
                passed.
        + Doc : More examples and a brand new synopsis.
        + Fix : The signature is no longer stored in the mg_private member of
                the MAGIC struct. This fixes possible clashes with magics from
                other extensions.
        + Fix : op info objects weren't blessed into the right class.
        + Fix : Races when initializing the op names cache under threads.

0.31    2009-02-19 23:50 UTC
        + Doc : A somewhat better introduction. The FUNCTION section was moved
                before CONSTANTS and HISTORY since it's more important. And
                'assignation' is really 'assignment', says Ricardo. :)
        + Fix : The op_info features are now thread safe.
        + Fix : Segfaults that occured when trying to get the op name during
                global destruction.
        + Fix : Segfaults and wrong "Unknown error" exceptions that happened
                when dieing in require caused a free callback to fire.
                Thanks Florian Ragwitz for reporting.

0.30    2009-02-12 17:05 UTC
        + Add : You can now get in all the callbacks either the name or a B::OP
                object representing the current op if you pass the new 'op_info'
                option to wizard() with respective values VMG_OP_INFO_NAME and
                VMG_OP_INFO_OBJECT.
        + Doc : Document magic on array/hashes values.
        + Fix : Completely skip free callbacks during global destruction.
        + Tst : Tests now pass again on 5.8.3 and lower (they were broken since
                0.27).
        + Tst : Test magic on symbol table and on array/hash values.

0.29    2009-02-08 11:10 UTC
        + Add : Set $_[2] to the default length for len magic on scalars.
        + Chg : Perl 5.8 is required.
        + Chg : The CLONE method will no longer be defined for non-threaded
                perls.
        + Doc : Nits.
        + Fix : The logic for turning off the GMAGICAL flag on hashes when no
                uvar magic is involved could do nasty things on tied hashes.
        + Upd : More resources in META.yml.

0.28    2009-01-24 17:05 UTC
        + Add : The 'copy_key' option to wizard(), that enables the safe edition
                of $_[2] in uvar callbacks to redirect actions to another key.
        + Fix : Exception objects thrown from callbacks at compile time were not
                available in $@.
        + Fix : free callbacks triggered during global destruction could lead to
                segfaults because the wizard was already freed.
        + Fix : Refcount of scalars with free callback.
        + Fix : Segfaults when using get or uvar magic simultaneously with clear
                magic.
        + Doc : The documentation about what the callbacks take and should
                return is now somewhat clearer.

0.27    2009-01-18 23:40 UTC
        + Fix : Offset of 1 with len magic on scalars.
        + Fix : Segfaults that seem to happen when one croak in a callback at
                compile time (thanks Ash Berlin for the testcase).
        + Upd : Resources in META.yml (Florian Ragwitz)
        + Tst : Large cleanup resulting in a wider set of tested behaviours.

0.26    2008-11-29 22:05 UTC
        + Fix : Leaks of cloned coderefs that access lexicals.
        + Fix : Building with maint-5.8 and blead (thanks Andreas Koenig).

0.25    2008-11-12 19:40 UTC
        + Fix : Compatibility with 5.8.9.
        + Fix : Old Pod::Coverage don't ignore CLONE.
        + Upd : META.yml spec updated to 1.4.

0.24    2008-10-12 14:55 UTC
        + Fix : Really fix it.

0.23    2008-10-11 17:25 UTC
        + Fix : Building on perls with multiplicity but not ithreads.

0.22    2008-09-29 19:40 UTC
        + Doc : Explain how magic differs from overloading.
        + Fix : Disable thread safety for perl 5.8 on Windows. If you want it
                enabled, reliable feedback is welcome.

0.21_02 2008-09-28 23:10 UTC
        + Fix : Hide previously deleted magic tokens in vmg_svt_free (Yuval
                Kogman).

0.21_01 2008-09-22 13:25 UTC
        + Chg : Shrink the context data.
        + Fix : Enable thread safety features for perls that just lack
                MY_CXT_CLONE.
        + Tst : Output threads and threads::shared versions in threads tests.

0.20    2008-09-20 23:35 UTC
        + Fix : The module is now thread safe. You can test if it had been
                built with thread safety features enabled through the
                VMG_THREADSAFE constant.
        + Fix : Correct backtrace when wizard() croaks.
        + Fix : 'cast $a, undef' should throw an 'invalid wizard' error instead
                of an 'invalid signature'.

0.19    2008-07-05 15:05 UTC
        + Add : The patchlevel with which the module has been built is now
                exported with the VMG_PERL_PATCHLEVEL constant.
        + Chg : Version checking macros overhaul.
        + Fix : 'uvar' magic should only be enabled in maint-5.10 and higher
                since it's never going to be backported to 5.8.
        + Fix : Likewise, the copy callback API change should only be enabled in
                5.11 and higher.
        + Fix : Instead of those ackward fake refcount increments in the wizard
                destructor, flag the wizard with SVf_BREAK and force temps
                cleanup. This should fix the wizard destruction for all perls,
                and solves the leak introduced by the previous solution.

0.18    2008-07-04 12:20 UTC
        + Fix : Enable uvar magic when patchlevel >= 28419.
        + Fix : Set VMG_COMPAT_ARRAY_PUSH_NOLEN for Windows ActiveState Perl
                5.8.x.

0.17    2008-05-11 09:05 UTC
        + Fix : 5.8.4 and lower don't have mPUSHi. Gah. Yeah, I know, I should
                use Devel::PPPort.

0.16    2008-05-10 22:05 UTC
        + Add : The samples/copy.pl script.
        + Chg : The sv_magical() + vmg_mg_magical() combo was simplified into
                vmg_sv_magicuvar().
        + Tst : t/33-code.t was testing scalars, not code.
        + Tst : is() and like() are better than ok().
        + Tst : 100% coverage reached.

0.15    2008-04-11 18:25 UTC
        + Chg : Factor vmg_cb_call{1,2,3}() into one function.
        + Fix : len magic is no longer called when taking the length() of a
                magical scalar since p32969. The VMG_COMPAT_SCALAR_LENGTH_NOLEN
                constant was added to cover this.
        + Tst : More tests for t/22-len.t.

0.14    2008-03-24 12:35 UTC
        + Fix : t/16-huf.t failures on Solaris and FreeBSD caused by not
                updating mg->mg_ptr after Renew-ing it on dispell.
        + Fix : Undefining MGf_DUP caused the wizard's magic to be wrongly
                initialized. MGf_DUP now appears as true from the user point of
                view, but the dup callback isn't actually set.
        + Fix : Warnings with blead due to copy callbacks now taking an I32 (API
                change #33256).
        + Fix : vmg_svt_val() and vmg_uvar_del() aren't required if no uvar
                magic is available.
        + Tst : Tests now output the version of optional modules loaded.

0.13    2008-03-19 14:35 UTC
        + Doc : Link to coverage report.
        + Fix : Correct dependencies listing in META.yml.
        + Tst : Improved test coverage.
        + Tst : Print the patchlevel as a comment.
        + Tst : Use is() where it's relevant.
        + Tst : t/16-huf.t now really tests interaction with H::U::FH.

0.12    2008-02-07 18:15 UTC
        + Fix : POD error. Thanks to Chris Williams (BinGOs) for the quick
                feedback.

0.11    2008-02-07 17:55 UTC
        + Add : Copy callbacks now receive the current key/index in $_[2].
                The current value/element is now in $_[3].
        + Chg : The trigger of copy magic on list assignment with perls greater
                than 5.10.0 was caused by uvar magic. Hence,
                VMG_COMPAT_HASH_LISTASSIGN_COPY was removed. Use VMG_UVAR
                instead.
        + Fix : Build failures on patched perls.
        + Tst : Added missing exported symbols to 01-import.t.

0.10    2008-02-04 11:30 UTC
        + Add : New script : samples/vm_vs_tie.pl, that benchmarks our uvar
                magic versus tied hashes.
        + Add : The VMG_COMPAT_* constants can be used from userspace to check
                perl magic abilities.
        + Fix : Callbacks that returned undef made us croak, breaking the
                variable behaviour (regression test in 14-callbacks.t).
        + Fix : uvar callbacks weren't tested for non-NULL-ity before being
                called (regression test in 28-uvar.t).
        + Tst : Fix typo in 25-copy.t that prevented Tie::Hash tests to be ran.

0.09    2008-02-02 11:30 UTC
        + Doc : Explicitely say that uvar callbacks are safely ignored for
                non-hashes.
        + Doc : Document caveats and fix the usual set of typos.
        + Fix : vmg_dispell() didn't check if the ext magic were ours when
                counting wizards that have uvar callbacks, resulting in a
                possible memory misread.
        + Fix : getdata() now returns directly the data object, and no longer a
                copy. This caused a leak.
        + Tst : Prefix author tests by 9*-.
        + Tst : New optional author test : 95-portability-files.t, that uses
                Test::Portability::Files when it's present.
        + Tst : New test : 14-self.t, that tests application of magic on the
                wizard itself.
        + Tst : Move Hash::Util::FieldHash tests out of 11-multiple.t to
                15-huf.t.

0.08    2008-02-01 16:55 UTC
        + Add : copy magic for tied arrays/hashes.
        + Add : local magic.
        + Add : uvar magics : fetch, store, exists, delete for hashes.

0.07_*  2008-01
        Internal development versions.

0.06    2007-11-20 10:10 UTC
        + Chg : 5.7.3 is now officially required.
        + Fix : "data" test failures on 5.8.{0,2}.
        + Fix : Drand01() vs rand().

0.05    2007-11-19 09:10 UTC
        + Fix : 5.10.0_RC1 compatibility fix.

0.04    2007-08-28 12:25 UTC
        + Chg : s/require (XSLoader)/use $1/.
        + Fix : Tests are now strict.
        + Fix : Complete dependencies.

0.03    2007-08-01 17:20 UTC
        + Add : Passing the signature of an already defined magic to wizard()
                now returns the corresponding magic object.
        + Add : You can pass the numeric signature as the wizard argument of
                cast(), dispell() and getdata().
        + Add : Any argument specified after the wizard (or the signature) in a
                call to cast() is now passed to the private data constructor in
                $_[1] and after.
        + Chg : $_[0] is now always a reference to the magic variable in all
                callbacks. The reason for changing from the previous behaviour
                is that one may want to apply the same magic to a plain scalar
                and to a scalar reference, and needs a way to distinguish
                between them in the callback (say, ref()).
        + Fix : Wizard object destruction used not to free the signature.

0.02    2007-07-27 13:50 UTC
        + Fix : In response to test report 548152 :
                Newx() and SvMAGIC_set() not present on older perls.
        + Fix : In response to test report 548275 :
                Since perl 5.9.5, 'clear' magic is invoked when an array is
                undefined (bug #43357). Moreover, 'len' magic is no longer
                called by pushing an element since perl 5.9.3.
        + Fix : Missing glob test in MANIFEST.

0.01    2007-07-25 16:15 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
