          mm prefetch usage
        - Added Storage::DBI subclass for MSSQL over ODBC. 
        - Added freeze, thaw and dclone methods to Schema so that thawed
          objects will get re-attached to the schema.
        - Moved dbicadmin to JSON::Any wrapped JSON.pm for a sane API
        - introduced DBIx::Class::set_inflated_columns

        - Fixed join merging bug (test from Zby)
        - When adding relationships, it will throw an exception if you get the
          foreign and self parts the wrong way round in the condition
        - ResultSetColumn::func() now returns all results if called in list
          context; this makes things like func('DISTINCT') work as expected
        - Many-to-many relationships now warn if the utility methods would 
          clash
        - InflateColumn::DateTime now accepts an extra parameter of timezone
          to set timezone on the DT object (thanks Sergio Salvi)
        - Added sqlt_deploy_hook to result classes so that indexes can be 
          added.
        - Added startup checks to warn loudly if we appear to be running on 
          RedHat systems from perl-5.8.8-10 and up that have the bless/overload
          patch applied (badly) which causes 2x -> 100x performance penalty.
          (Jon Schutz)

          sources using the same table
        - Row::insert will now not fall over if passed duplicate related objects

          same source with a unique constraint on it
