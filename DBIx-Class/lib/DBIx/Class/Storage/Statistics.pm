=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics - SQL Statistics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is called by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI as a means of collecting
statistics on it's actions.  Using this class alone merely prints the SQL
executed, the fact that it completes and begin/end notification for
transactions.

To really use this class you should subclass it and create your own method
for collecting the statistics as discussed in L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook>.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 new

Returns a new L<DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics> object.

=cut
sub new {
  my $self = {};
  bless $self, (ref($_[0]) || $_[0]);

  return $self;
}

=head2 debugfh

Sets or retrieves the filehandle used for trace/debug output.  This should
be an IO::Handle compatible object (only the C<print> method is used). Initially
should be set to STDERR - although see information on the
L<DBIC_TRACE> environment variable.

=head2 txn_begin

Called when a transaction begins.

=cut
sub txn_begin {
  my $self = shift;

  $self->debugfh->print("BEGIN WORK\n");
}

=head2 txn_rollback

Called when a transaction is rolled back.

=cut
sub txn_rollback {
  my $self = shift;

  $self->debugfh->print("ROLLBACK\n");
}

=head2 txn_commit

Called when a transaction is committed.

=cut
sub txn_commit {
  my $self = shift;

  $self->debugfh->print("COMMIT\n");
}

=head2 query_start

Called before a query is executed.  The first argument is the SQL string being
executed and subsequent arguments are the parameters used for the query.

=cut
sub query_start {
  my ($self, $string, @bind) = @_;

  my $message = "$string: ".join(', ', @bind)."\n";

  if(defined($self->callback)) {
    $string =~ m/^(\w+)/;
    $self->callback->($1, $message);
    return;
  }

  $self->debugfh->print($message);
}

=head2 query_end

Called when a query finishes executing.  Has the same arguments as query_start.

=cut
sub query_end {
  my ($self, $string) = @_;
}
