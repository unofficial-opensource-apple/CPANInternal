1.12 Fri Sep  9 2005
	- Added a fix for classes with insanely broken ->isa methods
	  that cause Perl to die.

1.11 Tue Sep  6 2005
	- It occured to me after I added ->find that what it _really_ is
	  is a way to find all the subclasses, but then include the class
	  itself in the returned list. This method makes much more sense
	  it I don't return the class itself, and rename it ->subclasses
	- Fixed broken Makefile.PL

	- Added the ->find method
