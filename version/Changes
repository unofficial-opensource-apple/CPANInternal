2006-02-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	No, really, the final changes before releasing to CPAN. :(

2006-02-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

2006-02-14  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Merge from version-combined branch.  Equivalent to RELEASE_0_53_03.

2006-02-09  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Commit changes prior to push to implement pure Perl alternative.

	* Build.PL
	    Need to exclude building on all 5.9.x bleadperl releases.

	* lib/version.pod
	    Forgot a quote in one of the example code fragments.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Sync with bleadperl.  Only warn if 'use warnings' is set.

2006-01-10  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Release 0.53 to CPAN.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    warn() when initialization string contains trailing characters
	    (rather than silently ignoring them).  Suggested by David Wheeler.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Test the above change.

	* README
	    Document the above.

	* lib/version.pm
	  lib/version/vxs.pm
	    Bump $VERSION.

2006-01-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	New version to deal with malformed input data that came up
	in bleadperl:

	  sprintf of version objects
	  <https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=37897>

	* README
	  lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm
	    Bump version.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Die if input value has underscore but no decimal.

	* t/01base.t
	  t/02derived.t
	    Use no_plan so I don't need to increment tests any more.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Check for malformed input.

2006-01-05  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Ready for new release to CPAN with minor changes.

	* lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Eliminate code I'm never going to use.

2005-12-03  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* lib/version.pod
	    PAUSE does so support version objects.  Elaborate on support
	    for Module::Build and lack thereof for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

2005-12-02  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* version/vxs.pm
	    Forgot to bump this.  When am I going to have inherited props?

2005-12-02  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL
	    Explicit minimum version of Module::Build.  Fixes
	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16249>

	* README
	    Whoo-hoo!  Remember to update this the first time.

	* lib/version.pm
	    Make sure that there is no possible way that Perl will
	    try to include the non-existant pure Perl vpp.pm

	* lib/version.pod
	    Complete rewrite that is hopefully easier to understand.

2005-11-01  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Use trinary operator to choose power of 10, rather than pow(),
	    which caused some problem with AIX 5.1.  Resolves:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=15254>

	* t/02derived.t
	    Suppress unnecessary warning when overriding qv() sub.

2005-10-10  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* version/README
	    Remember to update this for 0.49 release.

2005-10-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Fix Build.PL so Win32 will compile properly

2005-10-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* version/Build.PL
	    Explicit call to dist_name to help Windows DTRT.  Resolves
	    ticket:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14743>

	* lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm
	  lib/version.pod
	  t/01base.t
	  t/02derived.t
	  t/coretests.pm
	  vutil/vutil.c
	    Change implementation to return version objects instead of
	    version::vxs object.  Document that qv() isn't inherited and
	    give work around.  Update tests to no longer test version::vxs
	    class directly (since it doesn't work).  Resolves ticket:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14958>

2005-09-26  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Start POD rewrite.

2005-09-14  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Significant archectectural change (object hash has to contain
	reference to array not the array itself); see

	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14439>

	for details.  Initial changes to support pure Perl variant
	(not included yet), see

	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14417>

	for more details.  All POD moved to seperate file.  Tests
	abstracted out for reuse by different classes.

2005-09-07  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	"version" element of hash must be a reference, see:
	   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14439>
	for details.

	Also, function name changes backported from bleadperl version.

2005-08-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Badly written subclasses could SEGV (reported by Andreas Koenig).
	Now all version objects are validated before use.

	Add vverify() function to validate version objects and include
	it before each use of a version object.  Add tests for poorly
	written subclass that tickle the above function.

	Apply const'ifying from bleadperl and reformat calls to
	sv_[cat|set]pvf to be consistent with bleadperl source.

2005-08-22  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Leading whitespace or lack of leading zero caused the the object
	to be initialized incorrectly (reported by Andreas Koenig).

	Added POD for subclassing.  Removed cruft from README file.

2005-08-03  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Don't strip trailing zeros unneccesarily

2005-08-02  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Spelling fixes from "Piotr Fusik" <pfusik@op.pl>

2005-07-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Preliminary commit for rename of util.[ch]

2005-06-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Final changes to release 0.43 to CPAN

	*   README, lib/version.pm
	    Bump $VERSION number

	*   t/01base.t
	    Test that single term version expands to triplet for
	    $v->normal.  Eliminate "Exporter" from derived class.

	*   util/util.c
	    Various const'ifying to match Perl's own changes.
	    Handle short and really short array outputs in vnormal().

	*   util/util.h
	    const'ify Perl_scan_version().

2005-05-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Complete rewrite of parser to handle CPAN-style (two significant
	decimal) versions, as well as finish documenting the changes.

	*   util/util.c
	    Simplify parser to just count digits when parsing numeric
	    versions.

	*   lib/version.pm
	    Rewrite documentation on Numeric Alpha Versions and make all
	    examples consistent.

	*   t/01base.t
	    Add additional tests for CPAN-style alphas as well as
	    object->new().

2005-05-20  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*   lib/version.pm
	    Revised POD to correspond to new behavior with regards to both
	    Quoted Versions and Alpha Versions.

	*   lib/version.xs
	    Extend new() to be callable as an object method.
	    Copy existing object if called as object method with no
	    parameter.

2005-05-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Working towards a release to CPAN.

	*   README
	    lib/version.pm
	    First pass at documenting the external changes.

	*   t/01base.t
	    Since vcmp() is working again, can restore the minimum to the
	    use line.

	*   util/util.c
	    Finish up handling for vcmp to deal with alpha versions.

2005-05-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Almost completely working; only the comparison tests with
	non-objects is still failing.

	*   lib/version.xs
	    Simplify is_alpha() now that it is just as hash flag.

	*   util/util.c
	    Manually create and copy the hash elements when creating new
	    object from old object.
	    Forgot to make sure to display all subversion from short
	    numeric versions.

2005-05-15  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	    Replace ExtUtils::MakeMaker with Module::Build wrapper

	*   t/01base.t
	    Changed to prevent core dump (temporarily)

2005-05-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Implement alpha versions using secret array zero slot to
	differentiate between two place alphas (1.02_03) and three place
	alphas (1.002_03) so that versions which only use two significant
	places normally will still sort correctly with their alpha
	versions.

	*  util.c
	   (Perl_scan_version): Somehow manage to both simplify and
	   complicate the code at the same time.
	   (Perl_vnumify): use the new zero'th array element to distinguish
	   between 2 and 3 significant decimal places for printing.

2005-04-21  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*  util.c

2004-07-12  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*    util.c
	     Fix infinite loop for CVS-style versions of more than 3

2004-07-11  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*    lib/version.pm

	     named correctly (isn't that what this module is supposed to
	     fix?)

	*    version.xs:UNIVERSAL_VERSION()
	     Check for null sv before attempting sv_derived_from()
	     Thanks to Marcus Holland-Moritz <mhx-perl@gmx.net> for finding

	*    Makefile.PL
	     Add new target to automatically generate the 'Changes' file.
