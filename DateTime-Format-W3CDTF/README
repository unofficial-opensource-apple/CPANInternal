This module handles formatting and parsing of W3CDTF, a W3C sponsored, simplified
profile of ISO 8601 for the Web.  See: http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime

This is the native date/time format for Dublin Core, and RSS.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following in the distribution
directory:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

NOTE

Currently fractional seconds aren't supported by DateTime.pm, and therefore this
module does not support that part of W3CDTF.
