1.6  2003-08-23

- Scanning for subclasses now looks at @INC, instead of just the
calling module's directory.  Patch from Iain Truskett.

1.5  2003-07-30

- Fix a mistake in the documentation's SYNOPSIS.  Reported by Jay
Bonci.

- Added COPYRIGHT and SUPPORT sections to the docs, as well as a
LICENSE file to the distro.  Thanks to Jay Bonci for reminding me that
actually including a license is a good idea ;)

1.4  2003-02-21

- Add subclasses() function for backwards compatibility.  But it's
deprecated ;)

1.3  2003-02-14

- New maintainer - Dave Rolsky

- Internals and docs agree, and it all works.
