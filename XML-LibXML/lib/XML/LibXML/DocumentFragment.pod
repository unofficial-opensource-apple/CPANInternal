=head1 NAME

XML::LibXML::DocumentFragment - XML::LibXML's DOM L2 Document Fragment Implementation

This class is a helper class as described in the DOM Level 2 Specification. It
is implemented as a node without name. All adding, inserting or replacing
functions are aware of document fragments now.

As well all unbound nodes (all nodes that do not belong to any document
subtree) are implicit members of document fragments.
