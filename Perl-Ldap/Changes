 This is due to a bug in 5.6.0 when compiled with threads, see

  distribution

 KNOWN PROBLEMS
 --------------

  In a pre-release of 0.16 it has been seen that a search result may
  not contain all entries and $mesg->code will be LDAP_DECODING_ERROR.
  This has been seen when the client is running on NT or Linux and the
  server is an Exchange server.
