This package contain the Data::Dump module.  It is a simplification of
Sarathy's Data::Dumper.  I made it to demonstrate for Sarathy how I
would like Data::Dumper to work, and found it useful myself.  Sarathy
have plans to integrate this with his dumper, but while we wait, you
can test this out.

The Data::Dump module provide a single function called dump() which
you can import to your namespace if you wish:

     use Data::Dump qw(dump);
     $str = dump(@list);
     @copy_of_list = eval $str;

No OO interface is available and there are no configuration options to
worry about. Other benefits is that the dump produced does not try to
set any variables. It only returns what is needed to produce a copy of
the arguments passed in. It means that `dump("foo")' simply returns
`"foo"', and `dump(1..5)' simply returns `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)'.
