        - Added new option really_erase_my_files, which does what

          by Tsunoda Kazuya some months ago.  Not well tested.
        - Added "rescan" schema (and loader) method, which picks
          up newly created tables at runtime

          DBD::Pg trunk afaik)

        - fix for rt.cpan.org #22425 (use File::Spec where appropriate)

        - bugfix: mysql unique constraint code had an
          obvious but longstanding error
        - bugfix: columns were being specified out-of-order,
          bug was introduced in the 0.03004 column metadata
          dumping feature
        - dump code now skips+warns instead of dies when
          dump_overwrite not set

0.03004  Tue Jul 11 04:38:09 UTC 2006
        - make_schema_at efficiency improvements
        - improved debugging output
        - column metadata now included in dumped schemas

        - loader_options can now be embedded in the connection info
        - Documentation improvements
        - Deprecation notices updated, most things that became

          warnings (most did before).
        - Somewhat improved test coverage

0.03003  Tue Jun  6 02:22:49 UTC 2006
        - Fix inclusion of external add-on class definitions
          in dump_to_dir output.

0.03002  Tue Jun  6 01:27:25 UTC 2006
        - rethrow exceptions that occur during make_schema_at

0.03001  Mon Jun  5 23:17:57 UTC 2006
        - load_from_connection deprecation notice now mentions
          upgrading Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema if that module

        - Loader statement caching for better load-time performance
        - Improved Pg unique index loader, based on RDBO

        - More docs improvements
        - default uniq_info just warns and returns nothing now,
          instead of dying.  In theory, this allows unsupported
          DBD drivers to potentially work with this module, if
          the generic methods happen to work for that vendor.
        - New tests for the various current and legacy/deprecated
          methods of connecting a Schema::Loader class/object.

        - Fixed case-sensitivity issues for table/col names
        - Punt columns_info_for to ->storage

        - Removed unneccesary storage->disconnect

0.02999_03  Mon Mar 13 15:01:11 UTC 2006
        - Added EXAMPLE section to pod [Kieren Diment]
        - Invasive heavy changes to the DBI- and vendor-specific code
          (expect some breakage in some cases until this settles down)
        - Support for loading UNIQUE constraints
        - Tests cleaned up a bit
        - Relationship building seperated out into it's own file for
          the changes that are coming, but still does basically what
          it did before (this work is the next step).

0.02999_02  Sat Mar  4 16:53:21 UTC 2006
        - Merged in relevant changes from trunk since the split

0.02005  Mon Feb 27 23:53:17 UTC 2006
        - Move the external file loading to after everything else
          loader does, in case people want to define, override, or
          build on top of the rels.

0.02004  Mon Feb 27 23:53:17 UTC 2006

        - Shuffle the modules around
        - Make ourselves theoretically storage_type-agnostic
        - Remove the _db_classes stuff, bump PK::Auto to Base

0.02003  Sun Feb 19 20:42:01 UTC 2006
        - Deprecated arguments: dsn, user, password, options
        - New argument: connect_info

0.02002  Sat Feb 18 19:53:12 UTC 2006
        - Added moniker_map and inflect_map

0.02001  Fri Feb 17 20:25:40 UTC 2006
        - tests fixed up a bit
        - auto-loading of on-disk class definitions layered on top
          of the generated definitions (create Foo::Schema::Bar, then
          also try to ->require it if it exists on disk).
        - new parameters components and resultset_components, which do
          the obvious for the generated table classes.
        - DBIx::Class pre-req bumped to 0.05006, since Schema::Loader
          is virtually gauranteed to cause subtle mod_perl problems
          without those fixes.

0.02000  Sun Feb 12 22:43:47 UTC 2006
        - Just docs/version update, 0.01004 code released as 0.02000
