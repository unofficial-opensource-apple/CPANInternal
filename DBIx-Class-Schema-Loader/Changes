Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader

0.04005 Sat Apr 05, 2008
        - Fix DB2 support
        - Add support for load_namespaces-style class layout
        - Fix test skip count for main skip_rels block
        - Fix auto-inc column creation for the Oracle tests

0.04004 Thu Nov 15, 2007
        - Fix Win32 test skip counts for good (RT #30568, Kenichi Ishigaki)
        - Default Oracle db_schema to db username (patch
          from Johannes Plunien)

0.04003 Wed Oct 4, 2007
        - Prevent users from running Kwalitee test automatically
        - Fix extra whitespace being added to output on
          regeneration (from ilmari)

0.04002 Tue Jul 24, 2007
        - rescan method now returns the actual list of new tables
          loaded (previously, the return value wasn't taking
          constraint/exclude into account, even though the meat
          of the operation was).
        - Hid the Oracle module so that search.cpan.org will stop
          ignoring this package, temporary fix until perms are
          sorted out
        - Fix Win32 test skip counts (RT #27715, Alexandr Ciornii)
        - Fix a small output quoting bug (RT #28073, Tokuhiro Matsuno)

0.04001 Tue Jun 26, 2007
        - Deprecated dump_overwrite.  The changed behavior from
          0.03xxx was confusing.
        - Added new option really_erase_my_files, which does what
          dump_overwrite did in 0.04000, which is not what it did
          in 0.03xxx.

0.04000 Thu Jun 7, 2007
        - Added some env vars for controlling the Makefile.PL feature
          questions, to make automation easier.

0.03999_02 Tue May 22, 2007
        - Converted to Module::Install

0.03012 Tue May 22, 2007
        - Relationship names for multiple multi-col rels between
          the same table fixed by ilmari
        - Fix from Marc Espie for CREATE TABLE 'foo' for SQLite
        - skip ^sqlite_ tables in SQLite (thanks chromatic)

0.03999_01 Sat Apr 14 19:57:40 GMT 2007
        - Added *experimental* Oracle support from work done
          by Tsunoda Kazuya some months ago.  Not well tested.
        - Added "rescan" schema (and loader) method, which picks
          up newly created tables at runtime
        - Made dump_to_dir / dump_overwrite much more intelligent
          (they now preserve customizations by default)
        - Added support for DBI's new standard "statistics_info"
          method to gather unique key info (only supported by
          DBD::Pg trunk afaik)
        - columns_info_for imported from DBIx::Class
        - relationships are now on by default, use skip_relationships
          to disable them
        - Removed previously deprecated methods/options
        - Added $VERSION to all packages in this dist

0.03011 Sat Apr 14 19:03:07 UTC 2007
        - fix case-sensitivity in UNIQUE parsing for SQLite

0.03010 Thu Mar 29 12:36:19 UTC 2007
        - Workaround for new incompatible changes in DBD::mysql's "tables"
          method, which was causing us to find no tables w/ DBD::mysql
          4.002+
        - Fixed quoting problem in _table_columns (could cause crash when 
          dumping/doing a static create) (from ash)

0.03009 Wed Nov 15 14:03:37 UTC 2006
        - fix for rt.cpan.org #22425 (use File::Spec where appropriate)
        - use full instead of short classnames in relationships (from victori)

0.03008 Fri Oct 20 18:08:20 UTC 2006
        - fix for rt.cpan.org #21084 (dump_overwrite pathological output recursion)
        - fix for rt.cpan.org #21758 (mysql reserved words as table names)
        - fix for rt.cpan.org #21025 (SQLite FK parsing)
        - workaround for rt.cpan.org #21746 ($Class::Accessor::Fast::VERSION issues)

0.03007 Thu Jul 27 16:19:59 UTC 2006
        - Kill erroneous warning about connect/loader_options order (the real
          case is warned about elsewhere)
        - Fix t/22dump to work around ActiveState issues

0.03006 Wed Jul 26 00:14:58 UTC 2006
        - Fixed column-case issue w/ columns_info_for

0.03005 Wed Jul 19 15:09:30 UTC 2006
        [ Pretty much everything in this release originates from nilsonsfj patches ]
        - bugfix: mysql unique constraint code had an
          obvious but longstanding error
        - bugfix: columns were being specified out-of-order,
          bug was introduced in the 0.03004 column metadata
          dumping feature
        - dump code now skips+warns instead of dies when
          dump_overwrite not set

0.03004 Tue Jul 11 04:38:09 UTC 2006
        - make_schema_at efficiency improvements
        - improved debugging output
        - column metadata now included in dumped schemas
        - Carp::Clan added, and some dies converted to croaks
        - no longer overwrites files when dumping, unless asked
          to do so via the dump_overwrite option
        - loader_options can now be embedded in the connection info
        - Documentation improvements
        - Deprecation notices updated, most things that became
          "deprecated" in 0.03 are now marked for death in 0.04000
        - All deprecated usage patterns should now generate annoying
          warnings (most did before).
        - Somewhat improved test coverage

0.03003 Tue Jun  6 02:22:49 UTC 2006
        - Fix inclusion of external add-on class definitions
          in dump_to_dir output.

0.03002 Tue Jun  6 01:27:25 UTC 2006
        - rethrow exceptions that occur during make_schema_at

0.03001 Mon Jun  5 23:17:57 UTC 2006
        - load_from_connection deprecation notice now mentions
          upgrading Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema if that module
          seems to be in use.
        - DBIx::Class required version number fixed
        - Loader statement caching for better load-time performance
        - Improved Pg unique index loader, based on RDBO

0.03000 Tue May 23 12:56:05 UTC 2006
        - weakened the circular schema reference

0.02999_10 Mon May 22 18:58:20 UTC 2006
        - a few more small bugfixes
        - more dump/debug improvements

        - More docs improvements
        - default uniq_info just warns and returns nothing now,
          instead of dying.  In theory, this allows unsupported
          DBD drivers to potentially work with this module, if
          the generic methods happen to work for that vendor.
        - New tests for the various current and legacy/deprecated
          methods of connecting a Schema::Loader class/object.
        - Bugfix to the new runtime object connect/load code.

        - more backwards compatibility fixes
        - runtime connection definitions (and cloning) work fine now.
        - A couple of bugfixes related to db vendor "schemas", including
          a fix for http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=19164

0.02999_06 Thu May 18 16:32:41 UTC 2006
        - backwards compat with all earlier versions
        - no longer requires schema class to have a connection
        - correctly determine source class names in the rel code generator
        - fixed mysql testing w/o InnoDB

        - Backported Class::C3::reinitialize changes from -refactor
          branch, resulting in significantly reduced load time

0.02006 Fri Mar 17 04:55:55 UTC 2006
        - Fix long-standing table/col-name case bugs

0.02999_04 Fri Mar 17 03:55:09 UTC 2006
        - Fixed case-sensitivity issues for table/col names
        - Punt columns_info_for to ->storage
        - Large loading speedup (get rid of redundant C3 reinits)
        - Removed TEST_POD checks
        - Removed unneccesary storage->disconnect

0.02999_03 Mon Mar 13 15:01:11 UTC 2006
        - Added EXAMPLE section to pod [Kieren Diment]
        - Invasive heavy changes to the DBI- and vendor-specific code
          (expect some breakage in some cases until this settles down)
        - Support for loading UNIQUE constraints
        - Tests cleaned up a bit
        - Relationship building seperated out into it's own file for
          the changes that are coming, but still does basically what
          it did before (this work is the next step).

0.02999_02 Sat Mar  4 16:53:21 UTC 2006
        - Merged in relevant changes from trunk since the split

0.02005 Mon Feb 27 23:53:17 UTC 2006
        - Move the external file loading to after everything else
          loader does, in case people want to define, override, or
          build on top of the rels.

0.02004 Mon Feb 27 23:53:17 UTC 2006
        - Minor fix to debugging message for loading external files

0.02999_01 Sun Feb 28 00:24:00 UTC 2006
        - Shuffle the modules around
        - Make ourselves theoretically storage_type-agnostic
        - Remove the _db_classes stuff, bump PK::Auto to Base
        - Change default inflections to Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number::to_PL()

0.02003 Sun Feb 19 20:42:01 UTC 2006
        - Deprecated arguments: dsn, user, password, options
        - New argument: connect_info

0.02002 Sat Feb 18 19:53:12 UTC 2006
        - Added moniker_map and inflect_map

0.02001 Fri Feb 17 20:25:40 UTC 2006
        - tests fixed up a bit
        - auto-loading of on-disk class definitions layered on top
          of the generated definitions (create Foo::Schema::Bar, then
          also try to ->require it if it exists on disk).
        - new parameters components and resultset_components, which do
          the obvious for the generated table classes.
        - DBIx::Class pre-req bumped to 0.05006, since Schema::Loader
          is virtually gauranteed to cause subtle mod_perl problems
          without those fixes.

0.02000 Sun Feb 12 22:43:47 UTC 2006
        - Just docs/version update, 0.01004 code released as 0.02000

        - Fixed the has_many side of _make_cond_rel

0.01002 Fri Feb  3 23:14:38 UTC 2006
        - Email address typo :(

0.01001 Fri Feb  3 05:15:41 UTC 2006
